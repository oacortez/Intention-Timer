## Abstract
This is an interactive website where a user can set an intention to study, meditate, or exercise. 
Once the user has chosen their category they can then input what (specifically) they would like to accomplish during that time, and set a timer for the length of the session. Once they click the "start activity" button a timer will display and they can start the countdown whenever they would like.
