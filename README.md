## Abstract
This is an interactive website where a user can set an intention to study, meditate, or exercise. 
Once the user has chosen their category they can then input what (specifically) they would like to accomplish during that time, and set a timer for the length of the session. Once they click the "start activity" button a timer will display and they can start the countdown whenever they would like.

## Wins
- We got to display our countdown timer.
- We got to display differnt color buttons once selected and as well displaying errors messages when the user did not input anything into our main form.

## Challenges + Improvements
- A challenge we faced was creating the timer and as well displaying the timer. Althought the timer stops at 00:00 in the DOM the function is still being invoked in the background every second.
- A main bug we faced was our function for the timer kept getting invoked and as well we saw our timer going into negative numbers.
- Another main bug we faced was when a user clicked the "Start Activity" button the timer will be firing twice at the same time.
- We didn't have time to create cards of saved activitys. As well exploring local storage.
